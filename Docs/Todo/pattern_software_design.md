# Pattern Software design | Configs
{ todo, patterns }

Long term patterns should tell you which pattern instances there are and what all the settings are. For this we probably need a replacement for the Config System (or at least a translator that construct the config.)

Another solution would be for each pattern type, e.g. Shirt, maybe more specific or broader a "manager" that does that.

It could also be interesting to say we have only one overlay and with choices we go deeper and deeper to individualized the pattern we get. (Feels like traversing a tree or zooming in till you have what you want somehow.)

In any way, we need a solution; and should avaid redundancy.

Stages....

What do we give back at the end??
=> Pattern, Sketch, ...

Who has "the" sketch, how to stages communicate, ...
inheritance between stages / cross reference of possibilities
conditionals (only can add wing if not already done)

special stages:

meta-stage
directed-graph-stage

move to (next) stage with name/id
stages could (should) assert at beginning how it currently looks like.

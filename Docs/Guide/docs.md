# Writing Docs
{ guide, docs }

A doc consists of a title (see above) and an (optional) array of tags (see above.) The rest of the `.md` currently is just taken as is. 

If you don't want to include an `.md` file, name it `<yourname>.undoc.md`.
Other file types are not included in the docs. Or rather: in the undoc search.

For now you should probably only document what seems necessary to you. Also you can choose the format of the files as you wish (and change it between different files.) We need to figure out what works best for now anyway. If you indeed provide all information, ChatGPT or so can reformat it differently anyway.
